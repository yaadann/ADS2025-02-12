# Task

**Dominoes**

You are given a non-negative integer *n* whose representation contains at most 100 digits.

You need to determine whether it's possible to remove some (possibly zero) digits from this number such that after the removal the resulting number contains at least one digit and it is divisible by 8.

## Input

A single line containing a non-negative integer *n*. The representation of *n* contains no leading zeros and its length does not exceed 100 digits.

## Output

Print "NO" (without quotes) if there is no way to remove some digits from number *n* to meet the requirements. Otherwise, print "YES".

## Examples

Input №1
3454
Output №1
YES

Input №2
10
Output №2
YES

Input №3
111111
Output №3
NO
