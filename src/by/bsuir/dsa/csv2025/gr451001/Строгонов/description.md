# Task

C. Array Expansion with Zeros

You are given an array \( a \), initially containing \( n \) integers. In one operation, you can perform the following actions:

- Choose a position \( i \) that satisfies the conditions:  
  \( 1 < i \leq |a| \) and \( a_i = |a| + 1 - i \),  
  where \( |a| \) is the **current** length of the array.
- Append \( i - 1 \) zeros to the end of array \( a \).

You need to determine the maximum possible length of array \( a \) after performing any number of operations (including zero operations).
